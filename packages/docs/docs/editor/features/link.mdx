# Link

Link feature is included by default in the editor and it allows you to add hyperlinks. However in order to get the link editor modal, you need to add the `DialogLinkEditor` plugin to the editor.

```tsx live
<Editor>
  <EditorToolbar />
  <RichEditor placeholder="Add editable links" />
  <DialogLinkEditor />
</Editor>
```
